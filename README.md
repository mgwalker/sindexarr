Once upon a time, I'd never heard of map objects, but I was aware that you could
have "string-indexed arrays" in PHP. So I implemented something similar for C++,
and here it is.

Don't use it, though, because the standard template library has
[maps](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/). Use those.
